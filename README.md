# Binary-Classifier
Building a binary classifier to predict negative outcomes in a rocket stove project
common pitfalls and challenges you might face. to do so, we need to build and implement a classifier
Define the Problem:  what constitutes a negative outcome for the rocket stove (e.g., incomplete combustion, excessive smoke, low efficiency).

Data Collection: Gather historical data on various stove operations, including sensor readings (temperature, CO2 levels, fuel consumption), environmental conditions, and outcomes (positive/negative).

Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant features that influence the outcome. This may include real-time sensor data, derived metrics (e.g., combustion efficiency), and external factors (e.g., ambient temperature)

Model Training, Evaluation, and Deployment.
